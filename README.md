There are a lot of Javascript implementations of searching or fuzzy (approximate string) matching and filtering. Here you can see how each one deals with finding words from [a corpus of 22282 words](corpus.csv) so you can choose which one will fit better your autocompletion or fulltext search needs.

Go to http://fiatjaf.alhur.es/search-comparison/ and type anything in the input box to try out.

#### libraries being compared:

* [fast-fuzzy](https://npmjs.com/package/fast-fuzzy)
* [fuzzyset](https://npmjs.com/package/fuzzyset)
* [lunr](https://npmjs.com/package/lunr)
* [fuse](https://npmjs.com/package/fuse)
* [fuzzy](https://npmjs.com/package/fuzzy)
* [sifter](https://npmjs.com/package/sifter)

These are no performance tests, just a way to visualize the results each library yields.
